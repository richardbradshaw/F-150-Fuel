# F-150-Fuel

The Ford F-150 is the best selling vehicle in the USA. The fully electric 2022 F-150 Lightning joins the standard gas-powered and hybrid model F-150s, which allows us to make an apples to apples comparison of the fuel costs of driving all three versions of the F-150. Electric vehicles are better for the environment as they produce no tailpipe emissions, which offsets their higher manufacturing emissions (Wolfram et al., 2021) after only a few years of driving. Another advantage of electric vehicles is their lower cost of ownership due to reduced maintenance and lower electricity costs compared to gas. 

This repository contains the F-150_Analysis Jupyter Notebook that uses gas and electricity data from the US Energy Information Administration, and EPA vehicle fuel efficiency data to estimate the fuel costs.
